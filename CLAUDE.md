# Project Configuration for Claude

This file contains preferences and guidelines for working in this project.

## What this repository is

**snippet-cast** is a distributable Python library and CLI (`snippet-cast`) that
turns an **annotated Python snippet** into a **narrated screencast video**.
Narration is written as trailing `#:` comments on the snippet's own lines, so
the input stays valid, runnable Python. The tool renders syntax-highlighted
code frames with a progressive reveal, a Python-Tutor-style live variable
panel, optional burned-in captions and a typing-in animation, synthesises
speech per line, and stitches everything into an MP4 with ffmpeg. There is no
framework and no web server — it is a plain library + CLI, packaged with the
repo's usual pixi/setuptools/conda/PyPI scaffolding.

### Commands

Requires **Python 3.10+** (uses `int | None` annotations at runtime) and
**ffmpeg + ffprobe on PATH** (declared as a `[tool.pixi.dependencies]` conda
package). Python deps `pillow`/`pygments` are declared in `[project.dependencies]`;
`piper-tts` is an optional extra (`pip install snippet-cast[piper]`) since it
isn't published on conda-forge — kept out of the hard deps so the conda-forge
build's auto-mirrored `run:` requirements don't break.

```bash
# environment (pixi is this project's env manager)
pixi install                     # installs ffmpeg + pillow + pygments + snippet-cast (editable)

# run — proofing loop (no audio backend needed, fast)
pixi run snippet-cast test/data/fib.py  -o out.mp4 --tts silent --subtitles

# run — feature combinations
pixi run snippet-cast test/data/fib.py  -o out.mp4 --typing --subtitles      # first-exec + typing
pixi run snippet-cast test/data/loop.py -o out.mp4 --every  --subtitles      # per-iteration walkthrough
pixi run snippet-cast test/data/fib.py  -o out.mp4 --no-trace                # code + highlight only
pixi run snippet-cast test/data/twopass.py -o out.mp4 --tts silent --subtitles   # two-pass ('/' in narration)
pixi run snippet-cast test/data/twopass.py --export-script                      # narration script to record

# real voices (see SETUP.md)
pixi run snippet-cast test/data/fib.py  -o out.mp4 --tts piper
pixi run snippet-cast test/data/fib.py  -o out.mp4 --tts elevenlabs

# programmatic use
python -c "from snippet_cast import build; build('test/data/fib.py', 'out.mp4', tts='silent')"

# smoke-verify an output
ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration \
        -show_entries stream=codec_type,width,height -of default=nw=1 out.mp4
```

Automated tests live in `test/test_screencast.py` and cover parsing, tracing,
and beat-construction logic without needing ffmpeg; a full-render smoke test
runs only when ffmpeg and the configured `FONT_NAME` are both resolvable on
the host (`pytest -q`). See [Verifying changes](#verifying-changes) for the
manual recipe used to sanity-check rendered video output.

### Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/snippet_cast/screencast.py` | The entire tool (~700 lines): parse → trace → beats → render → TTS → assemble. |
| `src/snippet_cast/__init__.py` | Public API: exports `build` (programmatic), `export_script`, and `main` (CLI entry point). |
| `src/snippet_cast/magic.py` | Jupyter `%%snippet-cast` cell magic (`pip install snippet-cast[jupyter]`, `%load_ext snippet_cast.magic`). Deliberately **not** imported from `__init__.py`, so `import snippet_cast` never requires IPython — it's a thin wrapper: writes the cell to a temp `.py` file, calls `build()`/`export_script()`, displays the result with `IPython.display.Video`. |
| `SETUP.md` | How to install/configure the Piper and ElevenLabs TTS backends. |
| `test/data/fib.py`, `test/data/loop.py`, `test/data/twopass.py` | Sample annotated snippets used by tests and for manual verification (`twopass.py` exercises `/`-split, two-pass narration). |
| `test/test_screencast.py` | Automated tests: parsing, tracing, beat construction, and a full-render smoke test. |
| `*.mp4` | Generated outputs (not source; safe to delete / gitignore). |

### Architecture

Data flows through five stages; each has a clear boundary, so most edits touch
only one. Names below are the actual functions/classes in
`src/snippet_cast/screencast.py`.

```
source.py
  └─ parse()            -> code_lines[], markers[Marker]      # strip #: narration
  └─ trace_run()        -> steps[Step]                        # run under sys.settrace
  └─ build_beats()      -> beats[Beat]                        # mode-specific assembly
  └─ plan_canvas()      -> Canvas   (+ compose(), typing_frames())  # fixed-size frames
  └─ synth_*() + make_clip() + concat()  -> out.mp4           # TTS + ffmpeg
```

Key data structures:

- **`Marker`** `(line_no, text, has_code)` — a parsed `#:` annotation. `has_code`
  is False for comment-only (intro/outro) lines.
- **`Step`** `(line_no, disp, text, frame_id)` — one *execution* of a line, in
  completion order. `disp` = `{name: repr}` for the panel; `text` =
  `{name: str(value)}` for `{var}` interpolation; `frame_id` = `id(frame)`.
- **`Beat`** `(reveal_upto, highlight, narration, state)` — one render-ready unit
  = one frame + one narration clip. `narration` is already interpolated;
  `reveal_upto=None` means "show all code".
- **`Canvas`** — fixed dimensions + per-beat wrapped caption lines, computed once
  so every frame shares one resolution.

#### Two modes (set by `--every`)

- **first-exec (default):** one beat per marked line, using that line's *first*
  execution for state/interpolation. Code is **progressively revealed** up to the
  highlighted line. Typing animation applies here.
- **every-exec (`--every`):** one beat per *execution*, in trace order, so loops
  animate iteration-by-iteration. The **full snippet is shown from the start** and
  the highlight follows execution (progressive reveal is intentionally disabled
  here — a bottom driver call would otherwise make the reveal jump around).

#### Two-pass narration (orthogonal to the above, first-exec only)

`split_narration(text)` splits a `#:` narration on the first `/` into
`(part1, part2)`. If **any** marker's raw text contains `/`, `build()` takes an
early branch (`build()`'s `two_pass` flag) that calls `_two_pass_beats()` —
which calls the *unmodified* `build_beats()` **twice**: once with
`steps=[]` (part1 text; forces `state={}` everywhere, since `first.get(...)`
always misses) for **pass 1** ("writing" — always typed, via
`make_pass1_code_clip()`/`probe_duration()`, narration and typing start
together, opening on a blank canvas (`typing_frames()`'s `start_blank` path),
and the clip is sized to the narration's real duration), and once with the
real `steps` (part2 text) for **pass 2** ("walkthrough" — same per-beat
highlight/state/narration as single-pass first-exec mode, but
`_render_two_pass()` deliberately ignores each beat's `reveal_upto` here and
always composes the full code pass 1 already typed (`code_lines[:final_upto]`,
`final_upto = beats1[-1].reveal_upto`) — only the highlight and state panel
move per beat; the code is never hidden and re-revealed). `_render_two_pass()`
renders all of pass 1 then all of pass 2, concatenated into one video. A file
with no `/` anywhere never takes this branch — the original single-pass loop
in `build()` is untouched, so behavior for existing snippets doesn't change.

#### Custom narration order (first-exec only, orthogonal to two-pass)

Any marker's (post-`split_narration()`) text may carry a leading `N)` —
`_parse_order()` strips it, returning `(order, text)` or `(None, text)` if
absent. `order_markers(markers, texts)` pairs markers with their per-pass
texts, requires **all-or-none** numbering within that pass (`sys.exit` on a
mix), and — only when every text is numbered — sorts the markers by that
number (stable sort; unnumbered passes are left in source order, today's
default). `build()`/`export_script()` call it once for single-pass mode
(texts = each marker's whole `.text`); `_two_pass_beats()` calls it twice,
once per split-off pass, so pass 1 and pass 2 can use independent orders.
Because the returned `Marker` list is just fed into the unmodified
`build_beats()` in playback order, `build_beats()` itself needed only one
change to support this: `reveal_upto` is now a running **high-water mark**
(`max` of `m.line_no` seen so far in iteration order) instead of `m.line_no`
directly — code can only ever grow into view, so jumping ahead to narrate a
later line first reveals everything up to it, and a later beat for an
earlier line just re-highlights code that's already on screen. Rejected
together with `--every` (there, beat order already follows the execution
trace, not marker order, so reordering markers would have no effect on code
beats and would silently desync the every-mode comment-slotting logic, which
assumes `comment_marks` stays in ascending line order).

### Critical invariants — do not break these

These are non-obvious and fail *silently* or only under specific flag
combinations:

1. **All frames must share one resolution.** Final assembly uses ffmpeg
   `concat -c copy`, which requires identical stream params. `plan_canvas()`
   fixes W/H once (even numbers, for libx264). Any per-frame content change must
   fit the existing canvas, not resize it.
2. **All audio is normalised to 44.1 kHz stereo AAC** (`AUDIO_AR`/`AUDIO_AC` in
   `make_clip` and `make_typing_clip`). This is what lets silent typing clips
   concat with real-backend clips (mp3/wav/aiff of varying rates). Removing the
   `-ar/-ac` flags reintroduces a concat-copy mismatch that only surfaces when
   `--typing` meets a non-silent backend.
3. **Trace post-state is captured on the *next* same-frame line event** (or the
   frame's return), not on the line itself — see `trace_run`. That deferral is
   why "state after line L runs" is correct, including nested-call side effects.
4. **Loop-header exit beat suppression** (`--every`): a marked `for`/`while` line
   fires one extra time when the loop exhausts. `build_beats` drops it using
   `loop_body_ranges()` (AST) + `frame_id` — the exit check's next same-frame step
   lands outside the loop body. Don't remove this or loops gain a phantom beat.
5. **Parsing uses `tokenize`, not regex**, so a `#` inside a string literal is
   never mistaken for a marker. Keep it that way.
6. **`_render_code` guards empty content** (`code = " "`); PIL cannot encode a
   zero-size image (the intro comment-only beat reveals no code yet).
7. **`--every`/tracing executes the snippet.** `trace_run` runs arbitrary user
   code. This is intended (it's the user's own teaching code) but keep the
   `--no-trace` escape hatch, and never execute untrusted input silently.
8. **Interpolation uses `str(value)` snapshotted at capture time** (not `repr`,
   not a live reference) so `{i}` → `0` not `'0'`, and mutation/aliasing can't
   corrupt earlier beats. `{{`/`}}` escape; unknown `{x}` is left literal.
9. **Two-pass mode is auto-detected, never forced.** `build()`/`export_script()`
   check `any(TWO_PASS_SEP in m.text for m in markers)` — a file with no `/`
   anywhere must render exactly as it did before this feature existed. Don't
   thread two-pass-only conditionals into the legacy single-pass loop; keep
   the two code paths separate (see `_render_two_pass()` vs. the loop at the
   end of `build()`).
10. **A pass-1 "writing" clip's video is never shorter than its narration
    audio.** `make_pass1_code_clip()` sizes frame count from
    `ceil(duration * FPS)` (rounding up), so `make_typing_clip`'s `-shortest`
    only ever trims a sliver of excess video — it must never truncate real
    narration. Only the *silent* (empty part1) sub-case is capped by
    `TYPE_MAXFRAMES`; the narrated sub-case is deliberately uncapped.
11. **`reveal_upto` in first-exec mode is a running high-water mark, not
    `m.line_no`** (`build_beats()`'s `not every` branch). This is what lets
    `order_markers()` narrate lines out of source order without ever erasing
    code an earlier beat already showed — don't revert it to a direct
    `m.line_no` assignment, even though that's a no-op for the common
    (unordered, already-ascending) case.

### TTS backends

A backend is any `synth(text, out_stem) -> path_to_audio_file`; `make_clip`
re-encodes whatever it returns, so the container/rate don't matter. Registered
in the `BACKENDS` dict: `say` (macOS), `silent` (timing stand-in), `piper`
(local, `pip install snippet-cast[piper]` or bare `pip install piper-tts`;
voices need a one-time `python -m piper.download_voices <voice>`),
`elevenlabs` (REST via stdlib urllib), `manual` (your own recordings —
`BACKENDS["manual"]` is `None`, a placeholder just so `--tts manual` shows up
in argparse's choices; `build()` special-cases `tts == "manual"` and builds a
real `synth` via `make_manual_backend(manual_audio_dir)`, a closure that
serves `001.wav, 002.wav, ...` in call order). Config and setup live in
**SETUP.md**. Note: `build()` **caches audio per unique narration string** —
matters for ElevenLabs billing, for repeated loop lines, and for keeping the
manual backend's file-numbering aligned with `export_script()`'s (see
`_cached_synth()`/`_format_script()` — both dedup on the exact same
first-seen-narration-text rule, so the Nth unique line in the exported script
is always the Nth call to the manual backend).

### Verifying changes

After any edit, run this sequence and eyeball a couple of frames:

```bash
pixi run python -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('src/snippet_cast/screencast.py').read())"  # syntax
pixi run snippet-cast test/data/fib.py  -o /tmp/a.mp4 --tts silent --typing --subtitles
pixi run snippet-cast test/data/loop.py -o /tmp/b.mp4 --tts silent --every --subtitles
for f in /tmp/a.mp4 /tmp/b.mp4; do ffprobe -v error -show_entries \
  format=duration -show_entries stream=width,height -of csv=p=0 "$f"; done
ffmpeg -y -ss 2 -i /tmp/b.mp4 -frames:v 1 /tmp/frame.png   # inspect visually
pixi run python -m pytest -q                               # automated checks
```

`test/test_magic.py` covers the `%%snippet-cast` cell magic via
`IPython.testing.globalipapp.get_ipython()` + `run_cell(...)` (no real kernel
needed); it's skipped automatically if IPython isn't installed.

For trace/interpolation logic, prefer a fast unit check over rendering video:

```bash
pixi run python -c "import snippet_cast.screencast as s; src=open('test/data/loop.py').read();
cl,mk=s.parse(src); st=s.trace_run(src,'test/data/loop.py'); lr=s.loop_body_ranges(src);
[print(b.highlight, b.state, '::', b.narration)
 for b in s.build_beats(cl,mk,st,every=True,loop_ranges=lr)]"
```

### Conventions

- **`screencast.py` is single-file, stdlib-first.** Only hard third-party deps
  are Pillow and Pygments; everything else (HTTP for ElevenLabs, AST, tokenize)
  is stdlib. Keep new deps out of this file unless there's a strong reason.
  `magic.py` is the one deliberate exception — it needs IPython, so it's kept
  as its own optional module rather than pulled into `screencast.py`.
- **Tunables are module-level constants** at the top (`MARKER`, `STYLE`, `FONT_*`,
  `FPS`, `TYPE_*`, `AUDIO_*`, colours). Add config there, not as magic numbers.
- **ffmpeg is called via `subprocess.run`** with stdout/stderr to DEVNULL and
  `check=True`. Follow that pattern; surface real errors (see `synth_piper`).
- Private helpers are `_prefixed`. Rendering is split: `_render_code` (pygments)
  vs `render_panel`/`_draw_caption` (hand-drawn PIL).

### Common changes

- **Add a TTS backend:** write `synth_x(text, out)->path`, add to `BACKENDS`. Done.
- **Change theme/font:** edit `STYLE` (any pygments style) and `FONT_NAME` /
  `FONT_SIZE`; panel/caption colours are constants. Both the hand-drawn panel
  (`_mono_font`) and the pygments code frame (`_render_code`) resolve a font
  file via `_mono_font_path()`/`_FONT_CANDIDATES` first, falling back to
  `FONT_NAME`'s by-name OS lookup only if none of those paths exist — add
  paths to `_FONT_CANDIDATES` for a new platform/font rather than relying on
  `FONT_NAME` alone, since pygments resolves bare names against the OS's
  installed fonts (e.g. "DejaVu Sans Mono" isn't a stock macOS font).
- **Change the narration marker:** `MARKER` (keep it a valid `#` comment prefix).
- **Adjust typing speed:** default is `TYPE_SPEED` (seconds/char), overridable
  per-run with `--typing-speed`; `TYPE_MAXFRAMES` is a safety cap on frames
  per beat regardless of speed.
- **Two-pass narration:** add `/` to a `#:` narration (`split_narration`);
  first-exec only, auto-detected, no flag needed. `TWO_PASS_SEP` changes the
  separator character; `PART2_EMPTY_HOLD` is how long the walkthrough pass
  holds a beat whose part2 text is empty.
- **Custom narration order:** add a leading `N)` to a `#:` narration
  (`_parse_order`/`order_markers`, `_ORDER_RE`); first-exec only, per-pass in
  two-pass mode, no flag needed — all-or-none per pass, else `sys.exit`.
- **Manual-recording tooling:** `--export-script` (`export_script()` /
  `_format_script()`) and `--tts manual` (`make_manual_backend()`) — see the
  "Two-pass narration" architecture note above for how their numbering stays
  aligned with `build()`'s own audio-request order.
- **Jupyter `%%snippet-cast` cell magic:** lives in `src/snippet_cast/magic.py`
  (`SnippetCastMagics`, loaded via `%load_ext snippet_cast.magic`). It's a thin
  wrapper — writes the cell body to a temp `.py` file and calls `build()`/
  `export_script()` unchanged, so new CLI flags/backends need a matching
  `@argument(...)` added there to be reachable from a notebook, but need no
  logic changes.

### Known limitations / candidate next steps

- **`--every` on large loops** makes very long videos (one beat per iteration).
  The mooted fix is `--max-iters N` in `build_beats`: keep the first N iteration
  beats, then a single "… and so on" beat.
- **Live TTS is untested in CI** (no network in sandbox); the request shapes
  match current Piper CLI / ElevenLabs REST as of the SETUP.md date — re-verify
  against their docs if a call starts failing.
- **Two-pass narration doesn't combine with `--every`** (both `build()` and
  `export_script()` exit with an error) and makes `--typing` a no-op (pass 1
  always types, pass 2 never does) — this mirrors the existing
  `--typing`+`--every` restriction rather than introducing a new concept.
